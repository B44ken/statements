Our goal is to find financial statements for every municipality in Canada.

You should find a municipality with missing statements, search "<municipality> financial statements", then download the statements (might be called annual reports), ideally every year. 

Feel free to write a `notes.md` in each municipality folder to keep track of your progress or any issues you encounter.

The municipalities are given as the folders, so focus on empty folders first.
