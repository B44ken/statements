# Toronto (Ontario) – Notes

## What’s in this folder

For each year folder, `FinancialReport.pdf` is the City of Toronto “Annual Financial Report” (the City’s published annual financial report PDF).

For 2024, `ConsolidatedFinancialStatements.pdf` is also provided as a standalone PDF.

## Why there is only a standalone consolidated PDF for 2024

On the City’s “Annual Financial Report” page, the “Consolidated Financial Statements” are posted as a standalone PDF for 2024.

For 2023 and 2022, the page links the annual financial report PDFs, but does not provide separate standalone consolidated financial statements PDFs on that page; the consolidated statements content is included inside the annual report PDF.
