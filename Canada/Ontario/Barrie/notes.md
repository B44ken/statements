## Search Methods Used

1. Direct website navigation to expected financial statement URLs
2. Site search for "financial statements", "annual report", "consolidated financial statements", "audited financial statements"
3. Checked council meeting portal (https://barrie.legistar.com/)
4. Examined government/budget sections of the website

## Blockers

**Primary Blocker**: The City of Barrie does not appear to publish their audited annual financial statements on their public website. This is unusual for an Ontario municipality.

## Next Steps / Recommendations

1. **Contact the City**: Financial statements may only be available by request
   - Email: ServiceBarrie@barrie.ca
   - Phone: 705-726-4242
   
2. **Check Alternative Sources**:
   - Ontario Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing (FIR database)
   - Request directly from the City Clerk's office
   
3. **Verify**: Some municipalities only post statements in council meeting agendas/packages. May need to search through council meeting archives in the legistar portal.
