# Markham (Ontario) – Notes

## Blockers

Unable to access Markham's financial statements due to the following issues:

1. **Website Access Blocked**: The main City of Markham website (www.markham.ca) is blocked in this environment.
2. **Search Engines Blocked**: Cannot use Google or DuckDuckGo to search for the financial statements page.
3. **Old URL Structure Deprecated**: Attempted various URL patterns based on other Ontario municipalities, but the old `/wps/portal/` URL structure appears to be deprecated and returns 404 errors.

## Attempted URLs

The following URLs were attempted but returned "Page not found" errors:
- https://www.markham.ca/wps/portal/home/about/budgets-finance
- https://www.markham.ca/wps/portal/home/about/financial-reports
- https://www.markham.ca/en/business-and-development/budgets-and-finances

## Next Steps

To complete this task, the following actions are needed:
1. Access to the City of Markham website to locate the current financial statements page
2. Identify the correct URL structure for financial statements (the city appears to have migrated to Drupal 10)
3. Download consolidated financial statements and/or annual reports for available years
4. Organize files into year subfolders (e.g., 2022/, 2023/, 2024/)
