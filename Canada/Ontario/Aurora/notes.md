## Blockers / Notes

The Town of Aurora's Annual Financial Statements page currently only provides access to 2024 financial statements. 

Older financial statements (2023 and prior years) are not readily available on the municipality's website. The following locations were checked:
- Annual Financial Statements and Reporting page (main source)
- Budget pages for previous years (2019-2023)
- Council meeting agendas and minutes (eScribe system at https://pub-auroraon.escribemeetings.com)
- Various financial information pages on aurora.ca

It appears that Aurora may only publish the most recent year's financial statements on their website, or they may have migrated their website and not migrated older documents. Historical statements may need to be requested directly from the Town through a formal records request.
